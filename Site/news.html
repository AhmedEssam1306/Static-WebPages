                        <p>FC Barcelona were crowned as League champions after their win over Atletico Madrid in Vicente De Calderon. Messi, as always, was the hero for his team with a super goal in the 67th minute, the goal was more than enough to guarantee the title for the Blaugrana giants. Barcelona were in a good control over the game, managed to get important chances and converted one of them that was enough to give them the title as they were the favourites to do so. The Blaugrana fans celebrated all over Catalonia after the massive win, and they are very confident to achieve the treble for the second time in their history and be the first team ever to do so.

                        <p> Yaya Toure issued a startling rant at the 'indecent' and 'pathetic' African football confederation's decision not to award him the Player of the Year award. The Manchester City midfielder was pipped to the gong by Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as he missed out on winning for the fifth season running. Aubameyang, born in France but a Gabon international, has already scored 24 goals in 23 games this campaign and collected the prize on Friday.

                        <p>AFC Bournemouth are still waiting on a work permit for Juan Iturbe , but manager Eddie Howe is confident the situation will be sorted in the coming week. Premier League side Bournemouth completed the loan signing of Iturbe from Roma this month with the club retaining the option to make the move permanent for an undisclosed fee. The Argentine forward was unable to make his debut against Leicester City last week after failing to receive international clearance in time.

Bayern Munich boss Guardiola said he will move to England at the end of the season, with Manchester City the reported front-runners. But Van Gaal’s position at Manchester United remains under scrutiny after a woeful autumn, leading some to suggest the Spaniard could replace him at Old Trafford.
